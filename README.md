**Planned Features To Achieve These Goals**

- The website will use responsive design so it can be seen on different devices easily.<br>

### Dark Mode/Light Mode Toggle
- Switch between dark and light modes for comfortable viewing in different lighting environments.
- Dark mode enhances visibility in low-light conditions and reduces eye strain.

 ### Design

**Colour Scheme**

![Colour scheme](colour-pallet.png)


- `#333`: Dark gray, primarily used for background in dark mode and for certain text elements.
- `#whitesmoke`: Light gray, used for background in light mode and for contrast with darker elements.
- `#darkslategrey`: Dark slate gray, employed for headers, outlines, and certain text elements.
- `#slategrey`: Slate gray, used for button borders and certain text elements.

The dark gray (#333) serves as the background in dark mode, providing a sleek and modern aesthetic, while light gray (#whitesmoke) is employed for the background in light mode, maintaining readability and contrast with darker elements.

Dark slate gray (#darkslategrey) is predominantly used for headers, outlines, and certain text elements, adding emphasis to important sections. Slate gray (#slategrey) is reserved for button borders and certain text elements, providing a subtle contrast against the darker background.

These colours are used across both dark and light modes to maintain a sense of continuity however the usage of them differs across the modes to get the required effect.

#### Typography
- The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website, with Sans Serif as the back-up font in case Roboto isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean and simple font which is clear and easy to read and is used frequently so it is both attractive and fit for purpose.

#### Imagery
-   I chose not to include images to keep the design clean and focused on utility.

* ### Wireframes
I used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes before starting the project to help me plan the layout and flow of the project.<br>
When I was creating my website, the design plan was changed. Having never done the process before and lacking experience, my first designs were far to simple and lacking content and I had more time to add extra features to the site to add value, for examle, adding page specific reviews with images and a subscription form on every page.

## Testing

### Navigation bar links. 
Home, Gallery, Contact and Menus pages jump to the respective places when clicked. 
- These were tested a number of times. An issue arose when the site moved from the local browswe to published throu Girhub Pages. When this happend the links stopped working and an 'Error 404' page was shown. This was rectified by editing the filepaths to remove "/" at the beginning.
![Navbar Links](/docs/testing/navbar-links-matrix.png)

### Carousel Controls. 
Tested gallery controls checking carousel only moves on as a result of user input.
- The default of the Bootstrap carousel was that it would run automatically however I only wanted the image carousel to move as a result of user input. 
 ![Bootstarp carousel default](./docs/testing/carousel-controls-1.png)
- My first attempt was the change the 'data-ride="carousel"' to 'data-ride="none"'. However, this only changed the behaviour of the first slide, once past the first slide, the rest of the carousel ran automatically.
- After a deep dive into Bootstrap's documentation I added data-interval="false"' to the carousel div to disable the automatic cycling through the slides. 
![Bootstarp carousel fixed](./docs/testing/carousel-controls-2.png)


### Social media links open in the correct destination and in a new tab when clicked.

![Footer links](/docs/testing/footer-links.png)

- All links include 'target="_blank"' to ensure links open in a new tab.

![Footer Links Matrix](/docs/testing/footer-links-matrix.png)

### Contact Page Form. 
- Tested the form on the Contact page. All required fields worked and the submission button worked.
![Contact Form Matrix](/docs/testing/contact-form-matrix.png)

### Subscription Form.
- Tested the form on the Contact page. All required fields worked and the submission button worked.
![Subscription Form Matrix](/docs/testing/subscription-form-matrix.png) 


### Browser Testing.
- Tested with different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari(using my phone).

### Screensize and responsivity Testing.
- Tested with different screen sizes using the developer tool (Galaxy Fold, iPad, and my laptop)
    - - The site uses bootstrap across all pages to use a 1, 2, or 3 column layout. One column for small screen sizes, 2 columns for medium screen sizes and 3 columns for large screen sizes.<br>

**Homepage examples**

![Responsive homepage](./docs/responsive-homepage-2.png)

**Navbar examples**
- The site utilises a bootstrap component to collapse the navbar menu items into a toggle when viewing the site on small screens to keep the page neat and tidy.

![Responsive navbar](./docs/testing/responsive-navbar.png)
![Responsive navbar](./docs/testing/responsive-navbar-lg.png)

**Form examples**
- The site utilises media queries to organise form elements on the page in order ro manage space and content effectively. While the site as a whole uses a 3-2-1 bootstrap column design, I found that while this worked on small screens, it was not effective on medium to large screens as the half header half form weighting was not an effective use of space. After some reading I decided to add a media query to both the contact form and the subscription form. This media query and html changed the page make-up so that the header took up one third of the horixontal space while the form element took up two thirds. I also centered the header vertically to even out the use of space.

![Form Media Query small screens](./docs/testing/responsive-form-sml.png)
![Form Media Query meduim and large screens](./docs/testing/responsive-form-md-lg.png)

### Validator Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

**HTML**

-   [W3C Markup Validator index.html](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](/docs/testing/w3c-index.html-validator.png)
- - There were some 'Warnings' to do with header elements however these warnings do not take into account that the header for the content is in the previous section and the 'possible' misuse of an aria-label on my map. As these are warnings and not errors I ignored them.<br>


-   [W3C Markup Validator gallery.html](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](/docs/testing/w3c-gallery.html-validator.png)

-   [W3C Markup Validator contact.html](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](/docs/testing/w3c-contact.html-validator.png)
- - There was an issue with duplicate tags as this page had two forms on - one for contact and one for subscription- I edited the id's and labels to section specific ones. This fixed the issue.

-   [W3C Markup Validator menus.html](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](/docs/testing/w3c-menus.html-validator.png)
- - There was an issue with duplicate and stray div tags. Quick format and check and removed eroneous tag.

**CSS**
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](/docs/testing/w3c-css-validator-1.png)
-This brought the above error. I rectified it and retested. - [Results](/docs/testing/w3c-css-validator-2.png)

### Chrome's DevTools Audit Report

The Google Page-speed Services were used to assess the accessibiity of the project to ensure the site met expected accessible standards on desktop and mobile.

- In early development of the site, the site used two shades of green as opposed to blue. Through testing while coding, it became apparent that these colours did not work well from an accessibility standpoint as there was not enouth contrast. As part of the iterative process, I changed my scheme from green to blues which offered better contrast and accessibility.

![Google Page-Speed Insights Desktop](/docs/testing/page-speed-desktop.png)
![Google Page-Speed Insights Mobile](/docs/testing/page-speed-mobile.png)

-SEO score could be improved by adding a meta description tag to the head.<br>
-Page performance is an issue- possibly down to the large size of the main image on the site. Next steps would be to investigate reducing images without sacrificing quality.

### Lighthouse DevTools Audit Report

Lighthouse was used to assess the accessibiity of the project to ensure the site met expected accessible standards on desktop and mobile.

![Google Page-Speed Insights Desktop](/docs/testing/lighthouse-page-test-desktop.png)
![Google Page-Speed Insights Mobile](/docs/testing/lighthouse-page-test-mobile.png)

-SEO score could be improved by adding a meta description tag to the head.<br>
-Page performance is an issue- possibly down to the large size of the main image on the site. As above, Next steps would be to investigate reducing images without sacrificing quality.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- #### First Time Visitor Goals

**2a** From the navbar and so from any page, customers can view a dedicated Menus page with buttons to access copies of the current menus with prices. All menus open in a new tab.

![User Stories Menus Page](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-menus-page.png)
![User Stories Example Menu](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-menu-example.png)


3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to locate their social media links to join their followings on social media.<br>
**3a** The site includes a footer on every page with links to relevent social media. 

- #### Frequent User Goals
1. As a Frequent User, I want to look at gallery images.<br>
**1a** Currently, there is a dedicated gallery page with a carousel of images. This could be adapted as the site builds to become filterable by newest/oldest or by night/event.
2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see be able to refer to menu items.<br>
**2a** The dedicated menu page has up to date menus. This page could be enhanced with a "Coming Soon!" section for new/ seasonal menus. Customers can also choose to be kept up to date via the newsletter subscription.

3. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to sign up to updates about what is going on at the bar and be the first to know about any promotional offers.<br>
**3a** As per the wishes of the company to have a way to reach out to their customers, each page includes a form through which customers can sign up to a newsletter subscription.

![User Stories Newsletter Signup](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-newsletter-signup.png)


### Further Testing
-   A large amount of repeated testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs/ issues
**Performance**
- Performance needs to be enhanced, especially load time, and investigation work done around images slowing page performance down without sacrificing image quality.

**Coding issues**
- I came across an issue while building the site. This issue was made evident when viewing the menu page in smaller screens. Some horizontal sections of the page had white, empty space on the right hand side.
- - In the first instance, I added "container-fluid" to the required sections. While this worked with some sections - the coloured background spread to fit the viewport - the section with the menu cards and images was still pushing out to the edges and creating white space. I looked deeper into the bootstrap code.

![Bootstrap card default](./docs/testing/bootstrap-card-default.png)

- - Firstly I removed any default dimensions and measurements relating to the card image so that I could control this in css. 
![Menu Card HTML](./docs/testing/menu-card-html.png) ![Menu Card CSS](./docs/testing/menu-card-css.png) 

- - I then used css to change the width to 100% so the image will not push out its container.

### Improvements/ scalability 
- Improve load performance.
- improve SEO score through adding a meta description tag.
- **Gallery Page** as image library grows, consider grouping images into albulms/ folders and adding search or filtering/ sorting functions.
- **Menus Page** Add content for special/ seasonal menus to create buzz and excitement.
- **Frequent Users** Reward frequent customers and visitors to the site with special offers accessed through the website.
- **Response to Business need** As the info in the site is compartmentalised into pages, as the business grows, so too can the site. For example, an events page with a calendar could be added. A booking page linked to a back end system could be added also, or a page dedicated to education about the brewing process. Similarly, current pages could be adapted to growing need, for example, adapting the gallery page to have filters as the image gallery grows.
